# tar_scm (OBS source service) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm)

This is an [Open Build Service](http://openbuildservice.org/) source service. It uses an SCM client to checkout or update a package by creating a source tarball from a source code repository.

It supports many options, e.g. it can adjust resulting tarball parameters, include or exclude particular files when creating this tarball or generate an rpm changelog from the SCM commit log. For the full list of options please see tar_scm.service.in.

Apart from various SCM like git, hg, bzr or svn it additionally supports `--url` option that allows you to specify URL of the upstream tarball to be downloaded.

This is the git repository for [openSUSE:Tools/obs-service-tar_scm](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Tools/obs-service-tar_scm). The authoritative source is https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-tar_scm

The service can be used in combination with other services like [download_files](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-download_files), [extract_file](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-extract_file), [recompress](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-recompress) or [set_version](https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-service-set_version) e.g. within the [GIT integration](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_Concept_SourceService#Example_2:_GIT_integration) workflow.

## Archive Formats

### obscpio
The obscpio archive format is the new OBS specific archive format based on cpio which can be consumed and generated by the [OBS Delta Store](http://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.architecture.html#delta_store) to store changes in an incremental way independently from your chosen SCM.
This is output format generated by the obs_scm service and is basically the cpio newc format.
Additionally a file named <package>.obsinfo including useful information from your SCM system is generated, so you can access this data at buildtime.

### tar
The tar archive format creates a tarball and it is used as output format by the services "tar" and "tar_scm"

## Services

### tar_scm
tar_scm is the legacy service to create a source tarball from a source code managment tool.

### obs_scm
obs_scm uses the new obscpio archive format to store the sources
It is recommended to use obs_scm in favour to tar_scm as it helps to save a lot of disk space on the server side, especially when used in continuous integration (e.g. nightly builds etc.).
You can use the tar service and recompress service as a buildtime service to generate the usual source tarball while buildtime.

### tar
Create a tarball out of obscpio archives

### snapcraft
The snapcraft service can be used to fetch sources before building a [snappy app](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/snappy).
It parses a snapcraft.yml, for the SCM related parts and executes the corresponding services.

### appimage
The appimage service can be used to fetch sources before building a [appimage app](http://appimage.org/).
It parses a appimage.yml for the SCM related parts and executes the corresponding services.
